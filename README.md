# JSON diff and patch

`jd` is a commandline utility and Go library for diffing and patching
JSON and YAML values. It supports a native `jd` format (similar to
unified format) as well as JSON Merge Patch ([RFC
7386](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7386)) and a subset of
JSON Patch ([RFC
6902](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902)). Try it out at
http://play.jd-tool.io/.

## Example

Diff `jd a.json b.json`:

```JSON
{"foo":["bar","baz"]}
```

```JSON
{"foo":["bar","bam","boom"]}
```

Output:

```DIFF
@ ["foo",1]
  "bar"
- "baz"
+ "bam"
+ "boom"
]
```

## Features

1. Human-friendly format, similar to Unified Diff.
2. Produces a minimal diff between array elements using LCS algorithm.
3. Adds context before and after when modifying an array to prevent bad patches.
4. Create and apply structural patches in jd, patch (RFC 6902) and merge (RFC 7386) patch formats.
5. Translates between patch formats.
6. Includes Web Assembly-based UI (no network calls).

## Installation

GitHub Action:

```yaml
    - name: Diff A and B
      id: diff
      uses: josephburnett/jd@v2.1.2
      with:
        args: a.json b.json
    - name: Print the diff
      run: echo '${{ steps.diff.outputs.output }}'
    - name: Check the exit code
      run: if [ "${{ steps.diff.outputs.exit_code }}" != "1" ]; then exit 1; fi
```

To get the `jd` commandline utility:
* run `brew install jd`, or
* run `go install github.com/josephburnett/jd@latest`, or
* visit https://github.com/josephburnett/jd/releases/latest and download the pre-built binary for your architecture/os, or
* run in a Docker image `jd(){ docker run --rm -i -v $PWD:$PWD -w $PWD josephburnett/jd "$@"; }`.

To use the `jd` web UI:
* visit http://play.jd-tool.io/, or
* run `jd -port 8080` and visit http://localhost:8080.

Note: to include the UI when building from source, use the Makefile.

## Command line usage

```
Usage: jd [OPTION]... FILE1 [FILE2]
Diff and patch JSON files.

Prints the diff of FILE1 and FILE2 to STDOUT.
When FILE2 is omitted the second input is read from STDIN.
When patching (-p) FILE1 is a diff.

Options:
  -color       Print color diff.
  -p           Apply patch FILE1 to FILE2 or STDIN.
  -o=FILE3     Write to FILE3 instead of STDOUT.
  -set         Treat arrays as sets.
  -mset        Treat arrays as multisets (bags).
  -setkeys     Keys to identify set objects
  -yaml        Read and write YAML instead of JSON.
  -port=N      Serve web UI on port N
  -precision=N Maximum absolute difference for numbers to be equal.
               Example: -precision=0.00001
  -f=FORMAT    Read and write diff in FORMAT "jd" (default), "patch" (RFC 6902) or
               "merge" (RFC 7386)
  -t=FORMATS   Translate FILE1 between FORMATS. Supported formats are "jd",
               "patch" (RFC 6902), "merge" (RFC 7386), "json" and "yaml".
               FORMATS are provided as a pair separated by "2". E.g.
               "yaml2json" or "jd2patch".
  -v2          Use the JD v2 library and format.

Examples:
  jd a.json b.json
  cat b.json | jd a.json
  jd -o patch a.json b.json; jd patch a.json
  jd -set a.json b.json
  jd -f patch a.json b.json
  jd -f merge a.json b.json
```

#### Command Line Option Details

`setkeys` This option determines what keys are used to decide if two
objects 'match'. Then the matched objects are compared, which will
return a diff if there are differences in the objects themselves,
their keys and/or values. You shouldn't expect this option to mask or
ignore non-specified keys, it is not intended as a way to 'ignore'
some differences between objects.

## Library usage

Note: import only release commits (`v2.Y.Z`) because `master` can be unstable.

Note: the `v2` library replaces the v1 (`lib`) library. V2 adds diff
context, minimal array diffs and hunk-level metadata. However the
format is not backward compatable. You should use `v2`.

```GO
import (
	"fmt"
	jd "github.com/josephburnett/jd/v2"
)

func ExampleJsonNode_Diff() {
	a, _ := jd.ReadJsonString(`{"foo":["bar"]}`)
	b, _ := jd.ReadJsonString(`{"foo":["baz"]}`)
	fmt.Print(a.Diff(b).Render())
	// Output:
	// @ ["foo",0]
	// [
	// - "bar"
	// + "baz"
	// ]
}

func ExampleJsonNode_Patch() {
	a, _ := jd.ReadJsonString(`["foo"]`)
	diff, _ := jd.ReadDiffString(`
@ [1]
  "foo"
+ "bar"
]
`
	b, _ := a.Patch(diff)
	fmt.Print(b.Json())
	// Output:
	// ["foo","bar"]
}
```

## Diff language

Note: this is the v1 grammar. Needs to be updated with v2.

![Railroad diagram of EBNF](/ebnf.png)

- A diff is zero or more sections
- Sections start with a `@` header and the path to a node
- A path is a JSON list of zero or more elements accessing collections
- A JSON number element (e.g. `0`) accesses an array
- A JSON string element (e.g. `"foo"`) accesses an object
- An empty JSON object element (`{}`) accesses an array as a set or multiset
- After the path is one or more removals or additions, removals first
- Removals start with `-` and then the JSON value to be removed
- Additions start with `+` and then the JSON value to added

### EBNF

```EBNF
Diff ::= ( '@' '[' ( 'JSON String' | 'JSON Number' | 'Empty JSON Object' )* ']' '\n' ( ( '-' 'JSON Value' '\n' )+ | '+' 'JSON Value' '\n' ) ( '+' 'JSON Value' '\n' )* )*
```

### Examples

```DIFF
@ ["a"]
- 1
+ 2
```

```DIFF
@ [2]
[
+ {"foo":"bar"}
]
```

```DIFF
@ ["Movies",67,"Title"]
- "Dr. Strangelove"
+ "Dr. Evil Love"
@ ["Movies",67,"Actors","Dr. Strangelove"]
- "Peter Sellers"
+ "Mike Myers"
@ ["Movies",102]
  {"Title":"Terminator","Actors":{"Terminator":"Arnold"}}
+ {"Title":"Austin Powers","Actors":{"Austin Powers":"Mike Myers"}}
]
```

```DIFF
@ ["Movies",67,"Tags",{}]
- "Romance"
+ "Action"
+ "Comedy"
```

## Cookbook

### Use git diff to produce a structural diff:
```diff
git difftool -yx jd @ -- foo.json
@ ["foo"]
- "bar"
+ "baz"
```

### See what changes in a Kubernetes Deployment:
```bash
kubectl get deployment example -oyaml > a.yaml
kubectl edit deployment example
# change cpu resource from 100m to 200m
kubectl get deployment example -oyaml | jd -yaml a.yaml
```
output:
```diff
@ ["metadata","annotations","deployment.kubernetes.io/revision"]
- "2"
+ "3"
@ ["metadata","generation"]
- 2
+ 3
@ ["metadata","resourceVersion"]
- "4661"
+ "5179"
@ ["spec","template","spec","containers",0,"resources","requests","cpu"]
- "100m"
+ "200m"
@ ["status","conditions",1,"lastUpdateTime"]
- "2021-12-23T09:40:39Z"
+ "2021-12-23T09:41:49Z"
@ ["status","conditions",1,"message"]
- "ReplicaSet \"nginx-deployment-787d795676\" has successfully progressed."
+ "ReplicaSet \"nginx-deployment-795c7f5bb\" has successfully progressed."
@ ["status","observedGeneration"]
- 2
+ 3
```
apply these change to another deployment:
```bash
# edit file "patch" to contain only the hunk updating cpu request
kubectl patch deployment example2 --type json --patch "$(jd -t jd2patch ~/patch)"
```
