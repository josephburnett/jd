# RFC Standardization Path for jd JSON Diff Format

The jd format presents an innovative approach to JSON diffing with significant technical merit, but **RFC standardization faces substantial practical challenges** that require careful strategic consideration. This analysis reveals both the technical requirements and strategic realities of pursuing formal standardization.

## The RFC submission process demands extensive preparation and sustained commitment

The IETF RFC process requires **2-5 years of sustained effort** with multiple distinct phases. Initial Internet-Draft submission marks just the beginning—Working Group adoption, community consensus building, and IESG review each present significant hurdles requiring **active community engagement and technical excellence**.

**Critical requirements include** multiple independent implementations from different organizations, comprehensive interoperability testing, and formal specification documentation meeting RFC technical writing standards. The process prioritizes **community consensus over individual innovation**, making broad industry support essential for success.

Documents must include complete ABNF grammar specifications, detailed security considerations, IANA media type registrations, and extensive test cases. The **Standards Track requires demonstration of real-world utility** through operational deployment and proven interoperability between implementations.

## jd offers compelling technical advantages over existing JSON diff standards

The jd format addresses **genuine limitations in current standards**. RFC 6902 (JSON Patch) suffers from poor human readability, complex path construction with JSON Pointer requirements, and inadequate array handling. RFC 7386 (JSON Merge Patch) provides only basic merging capabilities with **significant functional constraints** including inability to set null values and limited array operations.

**jd's key differentiators include** human-readable unified diff-style output, superior array diffing using LCS algorithms with context preservation, and advanced features like set/multiset semantics. The format provides **format interoperability** by translating between jd, RFC 6902, and RFC 7386 representations, addressing integration concerns.

However, jd currently supports only a **subset of RFC 6902 operations** (test, remove, add) while missing move and copy operations. The path syntax differs from RFC 6901 JSON Pointer standards, creating incompatibility issues that would need resolution.

## Substantial technical and documentation gaps require resolution

**Current jd specification lacks RFC-required elements**. The grammar documentation remains incomplete (v2 grammar not formally specified), semantic definitions are informal, and error handling specifications are undefined. Security considerations, IANA registration requirements, and comprehensive internationalization support are missing entirely.

**For RFC compliance, jd needs** complete ABNF grammar definition, formal semantic specifications for all operations, comprehensive error taxonomy and handling procedures, security analysis addressing memory consumption and algorithmic complexity attacks, and IANA media type registration (`application/jd-diff+json` proposed).

The **single Go implementation represents a critical gap**—RFC Standards Track requires multiple independent implementations with documented interoperability testing. A comprehensive test suite covering edge cases, Unicode handling, and cross-implementation compatibility testing would be essential.

## Market dynamics present significant standardization challenges

**Community size remains insufficient** for RFC standardization success. With 2.1k GitHub stars and limited contributor base, jd lacks the broad industry support typically required. RFC 6902 and RFC 7386 have extensive implementations across programming languages and **widespread adoption in major platforms** including Kubernetes, ASP.NET Core, and Oracle Cloud.

**No major industry champion** currently backs jd standardization—successful RFCs typically have significant technology companies or organizations driving adoption. The **established standards momentum** creates substantial switching costs for organizations invested in RFC 6902/7386 tooling and training.

**Market need exists but is limited**. While developers experience legitimate frustrations with JSON Patch complexity and human readability issues, these problems haven't generated sufficient demand to overcome network effects favoring established standards.

## RFC standardization advisability: proceed with caution

**RFC standardization presents low probability of success** given current market realities. The combination of insufficient community size, lack of industry champions, and established standards momentum creates formidable barriers.

**Strategic considerations favor alternative approaches**. The JSON Schema community's recent departure from IETF due to process complexities illustrates challenges facing community-driven specifications. RFC standardization may be premature without first establishing broader adoption and community support.

**Technical merit alone insufficient**—jd addresses legitimate problems with compelling solutions, but standardization success requires community consensus and industry adoption that currently don't exist at necessary scale.

## Alternative standardization paths offer better strategic positioning

**Community-driven specification development** represents the most viable near-term approach. Focus should shift toward **organic adoption growth** through superior developer experience, strategic platform integrations, and expanded implementation ecosystem development.

**Specific alternative paths include** pursuing de facto standardization through widespread tooling adoption, working with organizations like Cloud Native Computing Foundation for industry-specific standardization, or developing W3C community group specifications targeting web standards ecosystem.

**Building implementation ecosystem** should precede formal standardization attempts. Multiple language implementations (JavaScript, Python, Rust, Java) would demonstrate serious intent and enable broader adoption testing.

## Essential steps for specification maturity

**Immediate technical priorities** include developing complete ABNF grammar specification, creating formal semantic definitions for array LCS algorithms, establishing comprehensive error handling procedures, and conducting security analysis addressing potential threats.

**Documentation enhancement** requires RFC-style technical writing with proper sections for security considerations, IANA registration requirements, and internationalization support. Creating **extensive test suites** covering edge cases and cross-implementation compatibility testing would demonstrate specification maturity.

**Community expansion** through **governance structure development**, maintainer base growth, and strategic partnerships would strengthen the foundation for future standardization consideration.

## Practical recommendation framework

**Short-term focus** (6-12 months): Develop formal specification documentation, create 2-3 independent implementations, build comprehensive test suite, and establish community governance structure.

**Medium-term strategy** (1-2 years): Pursue strategic integrations with major platforms (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Kubernetes ecosystem), demonstrate real-world utility through case studies, and build industry partnerships.

**Long-term consideration** (2-5 years): Reassess RFC standardization based on adoption metrics, community growth, and industry demand. Consider alternative formal standardization paths if adoption reaches critical mass.

**If pursuing RFC despite challenges**: Start with Informational RFC rather than Standards Track to reduce implementation requirements and accelerate timeline. Engage early with IETF JSON/web standards community for feedback and positioning guidance.

The jd format's **human-readable advantages and technical innovations merit preservation and development**, but standardization success requires patient community building and strategic positioning before formal standards processes can succeed.
